'''
Complexity: 

O(n lg n) time 
we only walk through our list once to merged them, 
but we wort all the meeting first --if our input were sorted we could
do this in O(n) time!

O(n) space
We create a new list of merged meeting time. In the worst case, 
none of the meetings overlap, giving us a list idential to the input list
